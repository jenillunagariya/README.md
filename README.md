# 🧬 Use of Biopython in Pharmaceuticals  
*Educational Case Studies for Bioinformatics Learning*

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the AI elective at Hochschule Ansbach by Riddhiben Dilipbhai Kumbhani and Jenil Dilipbhai Lunagariya (MSc Applied Biotechnology), under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Sibylle Gaisser.

Our aim is to create beginner-friendly, scientifically accurate Biopython case studies to help students learn how to apply Python to pharmaceutical and bioinformatics tasks — even with no prior coding experience.

---

## 🧪 Case Studies

We developed two practical case studies based on real-world bioinformatics workflows:

### 1️⃣ Gene Sequence Analysis  
- 🔧 Tools: `Entrez`, `SeqIO`, `Counter`, `matplotlib`  
- 📥 Task: Retrieve gene from NCBI (e.g. TP53), analyze base content  
- 📊 Learning: GC content, FASTA parsing, visualization  

### 2️⃣ Protein Structure Annotation  
- 🔧 Tools: `Bio.PDB`  
- 📥 Task: Load a `.pdb` protein (e.g. Hemoglobin 1A8O), list chains and residues  
- 🧠 Learning: Protein architecture, relevance to drug design

- Includes:
  - ✅ One fully working **Guided Notebook** (error-free, step-by-step)
  - 🧠 One **Interactive Notebook** (with TODOs for hands-on practice)
- Instructions provided in notebook headers
- Fully compatible with **Google Colab**

## 📨 Feedback Request

If you are a professional in bioinformatics, biotechnology, or education, we would appreciate your brief feedback:

- Is this biologically or educationally relevant?
- Is the explanation/student experience clear?
- Any improvements or ideas?

Even a quick comment would be helpful!
